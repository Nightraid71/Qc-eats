          What is QC Eats Premium?
        </h3>

        <p class="faq-text">
          QC Eats is a subscription service providing access to various benefits. Monthly memberships are priced at $8.99, while annual memberships cost $89.99. Collaborating with third-party partners, QC Eats extends discounted memberships to eligible users. Members enjoy a $0 Delivery Fee and a potential discount of up to 10% on eligible orders from restaurants and stores featuring the QC Eats icon. In case of discrepancies in the Latest Arrival estimate provided after order placement, subscribers receive $5 in QC Eats Cash for eligible deliveries. Recognizable by a gold QC Eats icon, eligible stores mandate a $10 minimum order for $0 Delivery Fee and up to 10% off at non-grocery establishments. For participating grocery stores, a $30 minimum order qualifies for a $0 Delivery Fee and a 5% discount. Additionally, members benefit from exclusive pricing on eligible rides, with the QC Eats icon indicating applicable perks. Taxes and fees, if applicable, are not factored into order minimums. The savings from the membership are subtracted from service fees, while additional fees and exclusions may be relevant.

          How do I cancel my QC Eats Premium?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          You have the option to terminate your membership through the app up to 48 hours prior to your upcoming scheduled payment, preventing any additional charges. To initiate the cancellation process in the QC Eats app, follow these steps: Click on the profile icon, select "QC Eats," and then navigate to "Manage Membership." Choose "End Membership" and confirm the cancellation by selecting "End Membership" again. Should you find yourself within the 48-hour window before the next renewal, kindly reach out to support for assistance. If you are currently enjoying a free trial of QC Eats and decide to cancel, the cessation of membership benefits will coincide with the cancellation date. For all other memberships, access to benefits persists until the conclusion of the ongoing billing period.

          Member Pricing on eligible rides benefit
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          All members are entitled to exclusive benefits when riding with the QC Eats icon. Certain QC Eats members enjoy a 5% discount on eligible rides, while others receive a higher benefit of 6% in QC Eats Cash back for these trips instead of the 5% discount. This QC Eats Cash is versatile, applicable to QC Eats transactions, allowing you to use it for both rides and orders.

Please be aware that it may take up to 24 hours for your QC Eats Cash to be deposited into your Wallet within the QC Eats App. Once the QC Eats funds are available in your Wallet, you can apply them to your next ride or order. It's important to note that QC Eats Cash is earned based on the subtotal of your final fare for eligible trips, excluding tolls, tips, taxes, and fees. No additional QC Eats Cash can be earned on the portion of membership QC Eats Cash used for trips.

Additionally, your QC Eats Cash will expire when your membership concludes. Navigate to QC Eats under "Account" to access and review your current benefits.

          What is the $20 credit on orders?
        </h3>
        <p class="faq-text">
          For qualifying deliveries, QC Eats members will be awarded $5 in QC Eats Cash if our Latest Arrival estimate for a completed order proves inaccurate. This estimate is provided after you place your order.

Following order placement, two time indicators are presented:
1. Estimated Time of Delivery: The earliest expected time for your order's delivery. This time may be subject to adjustments during your order, influenced by external factors like weather, courier availability, and restaurant preparation time.
2. Latest Arrival By: The best estimate for your order based on past similar orders. While we strive for accuracy, it may not be 100% correct at all times. This time remains constant throughout the order delivery.

To qualify for the $5 QC Eats Cash, the actual order delivery time must surpass the Latest Arrival estimate. Orders arriving before the Latest Arrival estimate are considered on time. To verify eligibility, check for the gold QC Eats icon beneath the restaurant name.

Please note: The Latest Arrival estimate is computed and displayed post-order placement and confirmation. Therefore, estimates shown before order placement do not contribute to the $5 QC Eats Cash offer.

    <div class="conclusion">
<p>The perks are exclusively applicable to qualifying establishments and rides featuring the QC Eats icon. For participating restaurants and non-grocery stores, a minimum order of $10 ensures a $0 Delivery Fee and a discount of up to 10%. Participating grocery stores require a minimum order of $30 for a $0 Delivery Fee and a 5% discount. The $5 credit is determined based on the Latest Arrival By estimate, established upon placing an order. Taxes and similar fees do not contribute to order minimums or ride benefits. Membership savings are implemented as a reduction in service fees, and additional fees or exclusions may be applicable.
